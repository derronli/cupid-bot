# Cupid Bot
A discord bot for personalized relationship help using generative AI and NLP\
\
Built with Python and Cohere API\

**Disclaimer:** Cupid bot is purely for entertainment purposes and is not indicative of my opinions on human relationshipsðŸ˜… 
## Motivation
The dreaded trap relationship questions where it seems like there is no right answer. *Would you still love me if I was a worm?*, *If you had to kiss my best friend to save my life, would you do it?*, *Aren't they pretty? They are so pretty right??* A real hair-puller right.
> Cupid bot aims to solve this problem by using previous conversation data and AI to construct the perfect, most optimal answer. Based on your personal speech patterns AND your significant other's ideal communication style

## Demo
Note that for this demo, Cupid bot was trained to mimic a very affectionate boyfriend whose replying to a girlfriend that responds well to sweet messages and compliments.\
\
**Invoking the \cupid_gen command in discord will prompt the bot to read in the previous message sent in the chat, and reply to it**

## Customization Demo
To effectively show Cupid bot's ability to match speech patterns and adapt to the target who it's responding to, I trained Cupid Bot on my friend and my chat logs

**Very different style**
